# Alzheimer's Classification

## This is a system consisting of a web application and an android application. The web application uploads the MRI scan of the patient to a machine learning model which classifies the stage and uploads both the stage and the scan to the database along with some more patient information. The android application displays the patient information and MRI scans on the device

## List of Patients

This page is visible after the doctor clicks on **My Patients** button from the navigation bar

## Upload MRI scan

Clicking the upload button on a patient from the list on the **List of Patients** page prompts the doctor to upload an MRI scan image

The image is then passed to the machine learning model which displays the output of the MRI scan below the upload button (shown in the screenshot below)

After the output of the MRI scan is displayed, the doctor can click the Upload Button to upload the image and its classification to the database (Upload button not displayed until the classification of the MRI image is done by the machine learning model to prevent any errors)
